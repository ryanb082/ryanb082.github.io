            <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h4>What is an "Escape Room" game ?</h4>

        <p>
        <h4>Why we are different:</h4>
        <p>The focus on our game is not escaping a room but saving Christmas, and it’s more suitable for all ages. From the most experienced player to a complete noviceWe are an experience that enjoyed by all ages and surpasses the limits of DzEscaping a Roomdzto make the participants the heroes of their own story. You don’t just Dzescapedz you save the day.</p>
        <h4>What is the puzzle?</h4>
        <p>Children and adults must help Santa Claus save Christmas by convincing a grumpy elf that the Christmas spirit is alive and well. Parents can help children win the game or watch the game progress while enjoying a drink in The Back Stage Lounge.</p>
        <h4>How does the game work?</h4>
        <p>Arrive 10 minutes earlier to your scheduled game time to be welcomed at thelounge. Confirm the name of the person who made your reservation, and when everybody is gathered we will start a brief explanation of the game and how everything works. You don`t have to bring anything with you, just your wits and curiosity.</p>
        <h4>Can I take pictures/notes/use my smart phone?</h4>
        <p>Sure! While the puzzles aren’t designed to require the use of a smart phone or taking notes, do whatever makes you feel confident. We ask that you do be careful what pictures you post to social media so as to not accidentally spoil the puzzles for future players, but otherwise have fun and share your experience!</p>
        <h4>What happens when the game starts?</h4>
        <p>Once the game begins and the timer starts counting down, everything is on you and your teammates. Figure out how to save Christmas!</p>
        <p>There is no physical strength needed for any of our games. Just explore your environment and solve the puzzles. If you need help, hints can be asked for by the Game Master. There’s no limit of hints you can request, but hints will be recorded to the leader board, so try and solve the game using as few as possible!</p>
        <h4>Do I need to make a reservation?</h4>
        <p>Yes, games are usually booked days in advance so we may not be able to accommodate your group without one.</p>
        <h4>Can I make a reservation the same day?</h4>
        <p>Yes, just check the availability online.</p>
        <h4>Can I bring kids along to Save Christmas?</h4>
        <p>Of course! But remember, children under 10 need to be an accommodated by an adult because otherwise they may not be able to solve the puzzles on their own.</p>
        <h4>What happens if I show up late for the game?</h4>
        <p>Please note that our games are live games and in session with a set time schedule. Unfortunately, if you are late, we cannot extend your game time because we have to get the room ready for the next appointment. We recommend using the remaining time in your session and a generous use of available hints!</p>
        <h4>Can I change or cancel my reservation?</h4>
        <p>We can change your reservation, depending upon our availability. You must contact us at least 48 hours prior to game time to change your reservation.</p>
        <h4>Can I make a corporate team-building reservation?</h4>
        <p>Yes! Please email us for special corporate team-building sessions.</p>
        <h4>Can I make a reservation for a special occasion or for a large group?</h4>
        <p>Yes! We are available to help you with private parties, including catering options.</p>
        <h4>Is your location wheelchair accessible?</h4>
        <p>Yes, we are fully wheelchair accessible.</p>
        <h4>Can I come alone?</h4>
        <p>Yes, but we recommend having at least two people, otherwise puzzles can be too challenging to overcome in the hour. Plus, Christmas is a season for sharing after all!</p>
